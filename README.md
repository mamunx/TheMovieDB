# TheMovieDB
An android app that fetches data from The Movie Database api and shows it. I created this project when I went for an interview in
Pathao, Bangladesh. They gave me this task. The task had other options like offline support and search options, which I couldn't
complete in time.

Features:

Three recycler view showing Top Rated, Now Playing and Upcoming movies. Searching option menu is there but not yet activated.
